# Soil

Soil is a Web Framework written in Crystal optimized for productivity and extensibility.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joaodiogocosta/soil.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joaodiogocosta/soil)

It is inspired by the most well known Ruby and Javascript web frameworks, inheriting the completeness of Ruby on Rails, the clarity and readability of ExpressJS and the simplicity of Sinatra.

## Current state

Soil is still a work in progress with a lot of missing features, but it will be constantly updated until it reaches a stable version.

## Installation

Add Soil to `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  soil:
    github: joaodiogocosta/soil
    branch: master
```

And then run:

```
$ crystal deps
```

## Basic Example

The following is a basic example that defines a `GET /posts` endpoint and responds with JSON.

```crystal
# blog_app.cr

class BlogApp < Soil::App
  get "posts" do |req, res|
    posts = [...]
    res.json(posts)
  end
end

BlogApp.new.run
```

And then run:

```
$ crystal blog_app.cr
```

## Routes

### Definition

Defining routes is extremely easy.

First, define a class that acts as a routes container, such as a Controller does in other web frameworks, and then define an arbitrary amount of routes by using methods such as `get` and passing a block handler that accepts `req` (request) and `res` (response) as arguments.

```crystal
class BlogApp < Soil::App
  get "/" do |req, res|
    # ...
  end

  post "/" do |req, res|
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Handlers

A Route accepts two different types of handlers, crystal's built-in [Proc](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/literals/proc.html) and [Action](#action).

#### Proc

A `Proc` is the simplest handler. To use it, simply pass in a block that accepts `req` (request) and `res` (response) as arguments:

```crystal
class BlogApp < Soil::App
  get "/" do |req, res|
    # ...
  end
end
```

#### Action

`Action` is a basic class that inherit from `Soil::Action`, which is just an absctract class that ensures that a `call` method is implemented:

```crystal
class PostsIndexAction < Soil::Action
  def call(req, res)
    @posts = [...]
    res.json(@posts)
  end
end

class PostsApp < Soil::App
  get "/", PostsIndexAction.new
end
```

This is particularly useful for endpoints that incorporate a considerable amount of operations, such as an enpoint that creates a new User account:

```crystal
class CreateUserAction < Soil::Action
  def initialize
    @email_sender = EmailSender.new
  end

  def call(req, res)
    user = create_user(req.params["user"])

    if user
      send_welcome_email(user)
      res.json(user)
    else
      res.status_code = 400
      res.json("message" => "Could not create User")
    end
  end

  private def create_user(attributes)
    User.create(attributes)
  end

  private def send_welcome_email(user)
    @email_sender.send(:welcome_email, user.email)
  end
end
```

And then use it in a Route:

```crystal
class BlogApp < Soil::App
  get "/", CreateUserAction.new
end
```

#### Multiple Handlers

Routes can have multiple handlers.

`Proc`s and `Action`s can be combined in arrays:

```crystal
class LogAction < Soil::Action
  def call(req, res)
    # Log something to STDOUT
  end
end

class PostsIndexAction < Soil::Action
  def call(req, res)
    @posts = [...]
    res.json(@posts)
  end
end

class PostsApp < Soil::App
  get "/", [
    LogAction.new,
    PostsIndexAction.new,
    -> (req : Soil::Http::Request, res : Soil::Http::Response) {
      # ...
    }]
end
```

### Hooks

```crystal
class Posts < Soil::App

  before do |req, res|
    pp req.params # print params before handler
  end

  after do |req, res|
    pp res.status_code # print status code after handler
  end

  # ...
end
```

### Namespaces

The following wil prepend `blog` to all routes, hence `/blog/posts`:

```crystal
class BlogApp < Soil::App
  namespace "blog"

  get "posts" do |req, res|
    posts = [...]
    res.json(posts)
  end
end
```

Namespaces are propagated to all routes.

```crystal
class Posts < Soil::App
  get "/" do |req, res|
    posts = [...]
    res.json(posts)
  end
end

class BlogApp < Soil::App
  mount "/posts", Posts
end
```
