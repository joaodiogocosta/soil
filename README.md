# Soil

Soil is a simple yet feature-rich web framework written in Crystal.

It is inspired by the most well known Ruby and Javascript web frameworks, inheriting the completeness of Ruby on Rails, the clarity and readability of ExpressJS and the simplicity of Sinatra.

## Current state

Soil is still a work in progress with a lot of missing features, but it will be constantly updated until it reaches a stable version.

## Instalation

Add Soil to `shard.yml`:

```
dependencies:
  soil:
    github: joaodiogocosta/soil
    branch: master
```

And then:
